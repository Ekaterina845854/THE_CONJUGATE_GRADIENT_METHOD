# THE_CONJUGATE_GRADIENT_METHOD
Conjugate gradient method with visualization and using the QT library

1) an interface for entering accuracy for one-dimensional optimization and accuracy for the end of the algorithm, the file name for saving
the results and the coordinates of the starting point of the calculation;
2) output of all calculation input data to the console or to the form;
3) output the number of iterations in the form or console;
4) output of a graph of successive iterations of the solution on the form or its visualization according to the output file data
